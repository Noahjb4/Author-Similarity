The sources that I used as references for my project was the complete works of William Shakespeare and also Harry Potter books 1-4 by J.K. Rowling and 5 different sources for comparison. For comparison, I used Harry Potter book 5, the King James Bible, The Spanish Tragedy, Grimm's Fairy tales, and a collection of poems by Rupert Brook. The sources that where more similar Shakespeare's were The Spanish Tragedy and Rupert Brook’s poems. The Spanish Tragedy was written by a contemporary of William Shakespeare, Thomas Kyd, and the poems where written at the beginning of the 20th century. All the other ones most likely came from J.K. Rowling given her harry potter books 1 through 4. 


I think that the classification works quite well. The two texts that are similar to Shakespeare make a lot of sense. One is a play written at a similar time to Shakespeare’s works so it makes a lot of sense that they are similar. The other is poems that Shakespeare wrote a lot of even though they are in different eras they are bound to be similar. For J.K. Rowling’s source, Harry Potter book 5 be similar to other Harry Potter books also makes sense as it was written by the same author. The other two are 2 are not quite so obvious but still make sense. Harry Potter and the fairy tales are both fantasy and fiction and more modern then Shakespeare so it makes sense that they are similar. On the other hand, the Bible could be more similar to Shakespeare or Rowling but I think there are a lot of similar themes in the bible and Harry Potter so it makes some sense even though the writing style is very different due to time period. Overall the classification seems to be quite accurate and consistent.
